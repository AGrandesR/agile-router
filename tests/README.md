# Tests
First of all. It is my first time using tests in a big scale. I have a limit time. I know that is not the best system of folders for testing.
I divide in two folders:
 - php: to try to test each file of every folders
 - router: to try to test the calls of the example project

It is very important to put in .gitattributes all the elements that we want to use to test or like playground but not is part of the framework.
